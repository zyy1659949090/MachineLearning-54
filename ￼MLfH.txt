About the Authors

Drew Conway is a PhD candidate in Politics at NYU. He studies international relations, conflict, and terrorism using the tools of mathematics, statistics, and computer science in an attempt to gain a deeper understanding of these phenomena. His academic curiosity is informed by his years as an analyst in the U.S. intelligence and defense communities.

John Myles White is a PhD student in the Princeton Psychology Department, where he studies how humans make decisions both theoretically and experimentally. Outside of academia, John has been heavily involved in the data science movement, which has pushed for an open source software approach to data analysis. He is also the lead maintainer for several popular R packages, including ProjectTemplate and log4r.

Colophon

The animal on the cover of Machine Learning for Hackers is a griffon vulture (family accipitridae). These considerably large birds hail from the warmer areas of the Old World, namely around the Mediterranean.

These birds hatch naked with a white head, broad wings, and short tail feathers. Adult griffon vultures - ranging in size from 37–43 inches long with an average wingspan of 7.5–9.2 feet - are generally a yellowish-brown with variations of black quill feathers and white down surrounding the neck. The griffon vulture is a scavenger, feeding only on prey that is already deceased.

The oldest recorded griffon vulture lived to be 41.4 years in captivity. They breed in the mountains of southern Europe, northern Africa, and Asia, laying one egg at a time.

The cover image is from Wood’s Animate Creation. The cover font is Adobe ITC Garamond. The text font is Linotype Birka; the heading font is Adobe Myriad Condensed; and the code font is LucasFont’s TheSansMonoCondensed.
