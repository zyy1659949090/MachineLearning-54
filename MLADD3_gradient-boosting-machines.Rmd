## Introduction

[Gradient boosting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gradient_boosting) is a machine learning technique for regression and classification problems, which produces a prediction model in the form of an ensemble of weak prediction models, typically decision trees. It builds the model in an iterative fashion like other boosting methods do, and it generalizes them by allowing optimization of an arbitrary differentiable loss function.

It is recommended that you read through the accompanying [Classification and Regression Trees Tutorial](decision-trees.ipynb) for an overview of decision trees.

## History

Boosting is one of the most powerful learning ideas introduced in the last twenty years. It was originally designed for classification problems, but it can be extended to regression as well. The motivation for boosting was a procedure that combines the outputs of many "weak" classifiers to produce a powerful "committee."  A weak classifier (e.g. decision tree) is one whose error rate is only slightly better than random guessing.

[AdaBoost](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AdaBoost) short for "Adaptive Boosting", is a machine learning meta-algorithm formulated by [Yoav Freund](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yoav_Freund) and [Robert Schapire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Schapire) in 1996, which is now considered to be a special case of Gradient Boosting.  There are [some differences](http://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/164233/intuitive-explanations-of-differences-between-gradient-boosting-trees-gbm-ad) between the AdaBoost algorithm and modern Gradient Boosting.  In the AdaBoost algorithm, the "shortcomings" of existing weak learners are identified by high-weight data points, however in Gradient Boosting, the shortcomings are identified by gradients.

The idea of gradient boosting originated in the observation by Leo Breiman that boosting can be interpreted as an optimization algorithm on a suitable cost function. Explicit regression gradient boosting algorithms were subsequently developed by Jerome H. Friedman, simultaneously with the more general functional gradient boosting perspective of Llew Mason, Jonathan Baxter, Peter Bartlett and Marcus Frean. The latter two papers introduced the abstract view of boosting algorithms as iterative functional gradient descent algorithms. That is, algorithms that optimize a cost function over function space by iteratively choosing a function (weak hypothesis) that points in the negative gradient direction. This functional gradient view of boosting has led to the development of boosting algorithms in many areas of machine learning and statistics beyond regression and classification.

In general, in terms of model performance, we have the following heirarchy:

$$Boosting > Random \: Forest > Bagging > Single \: Tree$$

## Gradient Boosting

[Gradient boosting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gradient_boosting) is a machine learning technique for regression and classification problems, which produces a prediction model in the form of an ensemble of weak prediction models, typically decision trees. It builds the model in a stage-wise fashion like other boosting methods do, and it generalizes them by allowing optimization of an arbitrary differentiable loss function.

The purpose of boosting is to sequentially apply the weak classification algorithm to repeatedly modified versions of the data, thereby producing a sequence of weak classifiers $G_m(x)$, $m = 1, 2, ... , M$.

## Stagewise Additive Modeling

Boosting builds an additive model:

$$F(x) = \sum_{m=1}^M \beta_m b(x; \gamma_m)$$

where $b(x; \gamma_m)$ is a tree and $\gamma_m$ parameterizes the splits.  With boosting, the parameters, $(\beta_m, \gamma_m)$ are fit in a *stagewise* fashion.  This slows the process down, and overfits less quickly.

## AdaBoost

- AdaBoost builds an additive logistic regression model by stagewise fitting.

- AdaBoost uses an exponential loss function of the form, $L(y, F(x)) = exp(-yF(x))$, similar to the negative binomial log-likelihood loss.

- The principal attraction of the exponential loss in the context of additive modeling is computational; it leads to the simple modular reweighting

- Instead of fitting trees to residuals, the special form of the exponential loss function in AdaBoost leads to fitting trees to weighted versions of the original data.

### Loss Functions and Gradients

```

```

The optimal number of iterations, T, and the learning rate, Î», depend on each other.

## Stochastic GBM

[Stochastic Gradient Boosting](https://statweb.stanford.edu/~jhf/ftp/stobst.pdf) (Friedman, 2002) proposed the stochastic gradient boosting algorithm that simply samples uniformly without replacement from the dataset before estimating the next gradient step. He found that this additional step greatly improved performance.

Some implemenations of Stochastic GBM have both column and row sampling (per split and per tree) for better generalization. XGBoost and H2O are two implemenations that have a per-tree column and row sampling. This is reason that these implementations are popular among competitive data mining competitors (e.g. Kaggle).

## Practical Tips

- It's more common to grow shorter trees ("shrubs" or "stumps") in GBM than you do in Random Forest

- It's useful to try a variety of column sample (and column sample per tree) rates

- Don't assume that the set of optimal tuning parameters for one implementation of GBM will carry over and also be optimal in a different GBM implementation

# GBM Software in R

This is not a comprehensive list of GBM software in R, however, we detail a few of the most popular implementations below: [gbm](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/gbm/index.html), [xgboost](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/xgboost/index.html) and [h2o](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/gamboostLSS/index.html).

The [CRAN Machine Learning Task View](https://cran.r-project.org/web/views/MachineLearning.html) lists the following projects as well.  The Hinge-loss is optimized by the boosting implementation in package [bst](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/bst/index.html). Package [GAMBoost](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/GAMBoost/index.html) can be used to fit generalized additive models by a boosting algorithm. An extensible boosting framework for generalized linear, additive and nonparametric models is available in package [mboost](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/mboost/index.html). Likelihood-based boosting for Cox models is implemented in [CoxBoost](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/CoxBoost/index.html) and for mixed models in [GMMBoost](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/GMMBoost/index.html). GAMLSS models can be fitted using boosting by [gamboostLSS](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/gamboostLSS/index.html).

Note that all models, data and model metrics can be viewed via the [H2O Flow GUI](http://127.0.0.1:54321/flow/index.html), which should already be running since you started the H2O cluster with `h2o.init()`.

# Early stopping example

                   sample_rate = seq(0.5, 1.0, 0.1),
                   col_sample_rate = seq(0.1, 1.0, 0.1))
search_criteria <- list(strategy = "RandomDiscrete", 
                         max_models = 20)

# Train and validate a grid of GBMs
gbm_grid <- h2o.grid("gbm", x = x, y = y,
                      grid_id = "gbm_grid",
                      training_frame = train,
                      validation_frame = test,  #test frame will only be used to calculate metrics
                      ntrees = 70,

gbm_gridperf <- h2o.getGrid(grid_id = "gbm_grid", 
                            sort_by = "auc", 
                            decreasing = TRUE)
gbm_gridperf
```

The grid search helped a lot.  The first model we trained only had a 0.774 test set AUC, but the top GBM in our grid has a test set AUC of 0.786.  More information about grid search is available in the [H2O grid search R tutorial](https://github.com/h2oai/h2o-tutorials/blob/master/h2o-open-tour-2016/chicago/grid-search-model-selection.R).
